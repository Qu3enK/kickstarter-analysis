# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
The Kickerstart Campaign effort is designed to assist Playwright Louise with establishing her first crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, 'Fever'. As part of the effort, information was collected from various other crowdfunding campaigns and will be organized, sorted and analyzed to determine the factors that make a project's campaign successful. [^1]

### Purpose
The purpose of the this analysis is to review the data of various campaigns and analyze the Outcomes and Goals in order to determine how they did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Once the analysis is complete share the results and findings with Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To perform the analysis for Outcomes Based on Launch Date, a pivot table was developed utilizing the Kickstarter data. I filtered the data by 'theater' from the Parent Category, so that we only look at the campaigns that are similiar to Louise's campaign.  The 'Date Created Conversion' is used to ensure that I view the months in which the campaigns were launched and performed a count on the Outcomes to display the campaigns performance by month. A line chart was created to provide a visual of the results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To perform the analysis for Outcomes Based on Launch Date, a table was developed utilizing the Kickstarter data. A dollar-amout range was created to group projects based on their goals and at each goal level the Outcome was counted and a percentage was calculated. A line chart was created to provide a visual of the results. [^2]

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenge was how to write-up the analysis. Would the analysis & results description be the same? In order to resolve it, I tried to look at each item from different perspectives. In other word, what is the ask above (analysis of Launch Date & Goals) and how does it differ from the Results questions. I also laid out my thoughts to others (inside and outside of class), which assisted me in gaining perspective.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch date are
1. Most Successful campaigns occurred in May and June. In December the number of Successful campaigns began to decline.
2. In October the number of failed campaigns spiked.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the results, 73%-76% of campaigns that had a Goal of 5000 or less were successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
For the Outcomes based on Goals, it takes into account all projects. It may be better to narrow the scope to provide the client with a better analysis for her particular area of interest

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Organize and analyze the data based on the Play's location. For instance, if Louise plans to put on her Play in the US, then organize and analyze the data for the US and create bar charts for the campaign goals and outcomes.
